# Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Expert Hub

This is a place for GitHub Copilot users to share their knowledge and expertise with the community. 

## What is GitHub Copilot Expert Hub? 

![ecosystem](docs/images/copilot-ecosystem-board.svg)

The Expert Hub aims to create a program office in which GitHub Copilot experts from your organization can share their knowledge and expertise with the community. These experts are internal advocates for GitHub, when we are not there. Share your thoughts, questions, and use cases that need to be covered with the team.

### Using Labels

[Add labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) to discussions to organize them more granularly. This will enable your community to filter by relevant labels and will also create more meaningful data insights for your community.

### Discussion Templates 

[Discussion templates](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/creating-discussion-category-forms) will encourage community members to include specific, structured information in their discussions by using discussion forms in your repository. With discussion category forms, you can create discussion templates that have customizable web form fields. Discussion forms are written in YAML using the GitHub form schema. Examples can be found in the [Discussion Templates folder](./.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/) of this repository.

## How does the Expert Hub get managed? 

Moderation of a community is incredibly important to the overall community health. The following best practice tips will help you maintain an active and healthy community

### ‚úçÔ∏è Reply to posts in assigned categories

Replying to questions and comments within a reasonable amount of time is important to ensure community members find value in your Discussions instance, and will encourage them to return and actively contribute to your community. In order to manage the workload we recommend assigning dedicated moderators per category depending on the new discussions volume created per day.

### ‚úÖ Mark comments as answers

If a question has been resolved, mark the best comment as an answer (see this example from the GitHub Community Discussions). This will aid community members in finding solutions to their questions and will motivate contributions as community members with the highest number of marked answers will appear in the ‚ÄúMost helpful‚Äù leaderboard of your Discussions community.

### ‚õî Manage spam

Spam is unlikely to occur in an internal community, however it may happen that community members post comments that are off-topic or engage in heated discussions. We recommend you warn offenders and hide their discussions. In cases of repeat abuse you may want to consider blocking someone from your community completely.

### üîê Lock or unlock Discussions

This is a valuable feature for scenarios when you want to keep a discussion in your community in ‚Äúread-mode‚Äù only but don‚Äôt want to enable community members to leave further comments (example: you requested feedback for a feature but collected enough information). Have a look at this post from the GitHub Community Discussions for reference.

### üóëÔ∏è Edit or delete comments

You have the option to edit or delete comments in case community members post inappropriate content or confidential information 

### ‚è™ Recategorise posts

Community members may accidentally post discussions in the wrong category. In order to keep your community clean and tidy, we recommend you move posts to the correct category.

### üè∑Ô∏è Apply labels

We recommend creating a variety of labels with regards to the format (example: question, feature request, bug report, feedback) as well as topic (example: Actions, Copilot, Codespaces) of discussions within your community. The ability to filter by labels will ease moderation, help community members find the right answers, and enhance the data you collect. To gain inspiration, take a peek at the labels we use in the GitHub Community Discussions.

## Who runs the Expert Hub?
