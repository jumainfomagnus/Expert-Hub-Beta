GitHub Copilot for Business GA Questions
GitHub Copilot General FAQ
## What is GitHub Copilot? 
  
 GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI models, a generative pretrained language model created by OpenAI. It is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim/Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).


GitHub Copilot is what is known as a “generative AI,” a catch-all term used to describe algorithms that synthesize existing data to create something new. Generative AI is a contrast to what is called “discriminative” AI that distinguishes between different types of inputs.Discriminative AI would be used to answer a question like “is this image a cat or a dog?” while generative AI would be used for something like “draw me a cat sitting next to a dog.”


The core of GitHub Copilot is a ‘“large language model’ (LLM)” created by OpenAI that focuses on generating code. This LLM is then supplemented by additional models from Microsoft and GitHub to improve the quality and security of results. Using a plugin in their code editor, a developer provides a “Prompt” to GitHub Copilot in the form of contextual information the GitHub Copilot extension sends when a user is working on a file and pauses typing, or when the user opens the Copilot pane, and GitHub Copilot then returns a code “Suggestion” to the user’s code editorIDE based on that context.


The user can then choose to accept or reject the Suggestion. If accepted, the user can then further edit the Suggestion as needed.

## How does GitHub Copilot work? 
  
OpenAI models were trained on publicly available source code and natural language, so they work for both programming and human languages.. The GitHub Copilot extension sends your Prompts to the GitHub Copilot service, and it relies on context, as described in more detail in the Privacy section.


## How does GitHub Copilot function internally? How do the algorithms work?
  
 This article from Stephen Wolfram does a good job explaining how LLMs work in-general. Copilot uses a highly customized version of GPT-family models to provide suggestions for coding languages in milliseconds.. We also use several other models to evaluate suggestions before they're shown to the user. 


For example, we use custom models client-side – in the code editor – to determine when to request a suggestion. We also use custom models in a proxy server to evaluate for slang, slurs, and hate speech so that GitHub Copilot only responds with professional suggestions. 


Last, we use custom models in the proxy to evaluate the quality of suggestions produced by the OpenAI models, and filter out suggestions with obvious security vulnerabilities.
##  What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?
  
GitHub Copilot is powered by generative pretrained AI models created by OpenAI. They have been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.
## Does GitHub Copilot write perfect code?
  
 In a recent evaluation in February 2023, we found that users accepted on average 35% of all completions shown by GitHub Copilot. We also found that on average more than 46% of developers’ code files were generated by GitHub Copilot, and in certain languages like Java that goes up to 61%. However, GitHub Copilot does not write perfect code. It is designed to generate the best code possible given the context it has access to, but it doesn’t test the code it suggests so the code may not always work, or even make sense. GitHub Copilot can only hold a very limited context, so it may not make use of helpful functions defined elsewhere in your project or even in the same file. And it may suggest old or deprecated uses of libraries and languages. When converting comments written in non-English to code, there may be performance disparities when compared to English. For suggested code, certain languages like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go might perform better compared to other programming languages.


Like any other code, code suggested by GitHub Copilot should be carefully tested, reviewed, and vetted. As the developer, you are always in charge.
## Will GitHub Copilot help write code for a new platform?
  
GitHub Copilot is trained on public code. When a new library, framework, or API is released, there is less public code available for the model to learn from. That reduces GitHub Copilot’s ability to provide suggestions for the new codebase. In the future, we will provide ways to highlight newer APIs and samples to raise their relevance in GitHub Copilot’s suggestions.
## How does a customer get the most out of GitHub Copilot?
  
GitHub Copilot works best when you divide your code into small functions, use meaningful names for functions parameters, and write good docstrings and comments as you go. It also seems to do best when it’s helping you navigate unfamiliar libraries or frameworks.
## How can a customer contribute?
  
By using GitHub Copilot and sharing feedback in the feedback forum, to help to improve GitHub Copilot. Please also report incidents (e.g., offensive output, code vulnerabilities, apparent personal information in code generation) directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes safety and security very seriously and we are committed to continually improving.




  
 We currently do not have a public facing roadmap for Copilot.
GitHub Copilot Product Overview FAQ
## What is the official name? 
  
GitHub Copilot is the product name.


## Is CfB the accepted colloquial abbreviation for the product? 
  
No. The product name is GitHub Copilot. We currently have two offerings: GitHub Copilot for Individuals and GitHub Copilot for Business. We will use the offering name when necessary to distinguish any differences between the two offerings.  




## What is the cost for GitHub Copilot for Business?
  
 $19/seat per month.
## Is there a compute cost associated?
  
 No.
## How is GitHub Copilot being used in GitHub?
  
 GitHub Copilot is used by engineers in both GitHub and Microsoft to build products ranging from Codespaces to Actions, GHAS to Repositories, VS Code to .NET. It's a part of the typical engineer's toolbelt, alongside other essentials such as a code editor or command line tool.
## Can you explain the pricing model for GitHub Copilot for Business and GitHub Copilot for Individuals?
  
 GitHub Copilot for Business is generally available at $19/seat per month. Billing is based on when a seat is assigned and customers will have the flexibility to scale up or down the number of seats at any time during the month. New seats assigned will be prorated based on the day the user is assigned. Unassigned seats will be batched and removed at the end of the billing month.


GitHub Copilot for Individuals is generally available to all developers at $10/month or $100/year. Because we care deeply about continuous learning and the open source community, we’ve also made GitHub Copilot available free to verified students, teachers, and maintainers of popular open source projects.
## Why does GitHub Copilot for Business cost 9 dollars more per seat than GitHub Copilot for Individuals?
  
GitHub Copilot for Business expands upon the capabilities of GitHub Copilot for Individuals in the following ways:
* Admin Seat Management
* No Opt-In for data collection
   * For business customers, we do not enable the ability for GitHub to retain Prompts or Suggestions regardless if the data originates from public repos, private repos, non-GH repos or local files.
* Organization-wide Policy Controls
   * Setting controls for Suggestions Matching Public Code 
* Integrated Billing: GitHub Copilot for Business will be invoiced on a per user basis, monthly or charged on a subscription basis via credit card. Admins can view Billing details at the enterprise level. 
* Enhanced corporate proxy support


## Why is GitHub Copilot for Individuals only free for maintainers of popular open source software, teachers, and students?
  
 GitHub Copilot wouldn’t be possible without GitHub’s vibrant community of students and creators. To support and give back to those communities, we’re making GitHub Copilot available for free to verified students and maintainers of popular open source projects.


If you’re a student and want to participate in the program, apply for the GitHub Student Pack to get started. And if you’re an open source maintainer, check out our FAQ to see if you qualify to start using GitHub Copilot at no cost. See blog post.




## What are the capabilities of GitHub Copilot for Business?
  
Enterprise admins can enable GitHub Copilot for Business at the Enterprise Account level, and select which organizations are allowed to use GitHub Copilot for Business (thus only giving org admins the ability to assign seats).
* As an admin, I can purchase and assign licenses on behalf of my team
* As an admin, I can dictate user settings on behalf of my team (e.g. "enable filtering for all users")
* Org owners can enable GitHub Copilot for Business for their teams and individual users


Prompts and Suggestions are transmitted in real-time only to return suggestions and discarded once a suggestion is returned. No Prompts or Suggestions are retained, including code content, code prompts, code suggestions, nor content from neighboring tabs and local file systems.


## Are the AI model updates and new features with the February launch unique to GitHub Copilot for Business or do some also apply to GitHub Copilot for Individuals?
* Most of the product enhancements, such as improvements to quality in code suggestions and the AI-based vulnerability prevention system, apply to both CfB and CfI 
* VPN (self-signed certificate), however, is a CfB only feature that is new.


## What languages are supported?
  
All languages are supported, however the more common a language, the better represented it will be in our training data and the more robust suggestions will be.


## How often are GitHub Copilot's suggestions accepted?
  
In a recent evaluation in February 2023, we found that users accepted on average 35% of all completions shown by GitHub Copilot. We also found that on average more than 46% of developers’ code files were generated by GitHub Copilot, and in certain languages like Python that goes up to 61%. 


## How do we know GitHub Copilot is useful?
  
GitHub has run multiple experiments that show GitHub Copilot increases developer velocity and output and customer reception has been overwhelmingly positive. For more information, read the blog.


## Is the reasoning we landed on 150 chars to remove Suggestions matching public facing code documented anywhere?
  
 There's no magic number or rationale that guarantees 150 is better than 145, 170, etc. We chose 150 based on a few criteria. 


First, we wanted to compare only non-trivial code fragments so that we didn't block obviously common phrases used in programming languages. 


Second, through experimentation, we determined that by only filtering Suggestions above 150 characters, we didn't significantly impact the number of suggestions committed to code – that is to say, the developer experience wasn't significantly impacted. 


Once Snippy v2 is released, users will have the ability to see matches and an outline of where else they appear, instead of such matches being blocked upfront. 
## What does the actual GitHub Copilot for Business configuration experience and UI look like?
  Here are external-facing, customer-friendly videos available on YouTube as unlisted:
* Guru card for future searchability (or search `/guru Copilot customer facing videos` in Slack)
* YouTube Playlist, they consist of:
   * Org Admin Experience 
   * Ent Admin Experience
   * Billing Explained
   * Customer Interview on Copilot
## What’s the one key (core) message we want users to walk away with regarding GitHub Copilot for Business?
  
 This will give businesses the proven benefits of core AI-assisted technologies, as well as added admin controls to allow or block suggestions matching public code on behalf of your organization. Because of how GitHub Copilot understands natural language and code, it gives you WAY more than just a productivity boost. It helps you focus on business logic-over-boilerplate, and discover ideas you might not have otherwise considered. All from the comfort of your editor.


We’re enabling businesses to be able to purchase and manage seats for GitHub Copilot for Business for their employees. GitHub Copilot for Business will offer the same core AI-assisted technologies and introduce admin controls to enforce use policies on behalf of their organization.

   4. Produces better quality suggestions for languages that have large, comprehensive, and diverse representation in the training set


USER TESTIMONIALS 


“GitHub Copilot has been used by my team to accelerate coding in a fast but efficient way. Our team was looking to improve code productivity and our coding standards through reuse. We were searching for multiple options and landed on this wonderful tool. With GitHub Copilot, our team was able to reuse methods within and outside our project’s codebase via the VS Code plugin. Our development efforts were significantly reduced – by 30% – which we owe to GitHub Copilot as we can focus more on code quality and performance optimization rather than creating new code.” 
- Balakrishnan Viswanathan, Fortune 100 Consulting Company

“I used GitHub Copilot to write a web scraping script recently. Very routine, but a lot of edge cases and things to look up and test. GitHub Copilot let me just stay in VS Code, write natural English comments and get code that I knew I could write anyway but no longer have to. I stay in flow, and get stuff done 2x faster. I can’t live without GitHub Copilot now, every other coding experience is now broken without it.” 
- Shawn Wang, Head of Developer Experience, Airbyte

“Some of our engineers just told me they’d estimate 40% of the lines of code they produce are now written by the GitHub Copilot AI.” 
- JD Ross, Co-founder, Royal


“I remember writing a bunch of boilerplate setting up a GraphQL schema, and the second I wrote the name of a class, GitHub Copilot filled out the entire declaration for me. A few minutes of work took less than 2 seconds. ” 
- Kedar Rudrawar, Software Engineer, SF-based startup


“We have been using GitHub Copilot for four months now, as we have been quickly iterating on prototypes for Olto.com. GitHub Copilot has reduced the cost of experimentation and has enabled us to iterate faster. It is critical at this early stage, as it improves our odds of success. In particular, it helped along two vectors - first is efficiency, reviewing code is much faster than writing it; second is coaching, as former Java developers toying with Typescript, it was super helpful to have GitHub Copilot as a coach for syntax and structure.” 
- Jean-Baptiste Chaput, Co-founder and CTO, Olto.com


“GitHub Copilot is [an] incredibly useful tool for writing technical blog posts. In this case it read the previous paragraph where I explained what I’m about to demonstrate and it wrote down the right Rust code including the necessary reStructuredText bits.” - Armin Ronacher, Principal Architect, Sentry (Note: quote can only be used internally unless approval is granted first by Sentry).

“I’ve been using GitHub Copilot for a few days now. I’ve been in software nearly 2 decades and I’m trying to remember the last time something felt this magical. I’m googling a lot less because it just figures out what I want. Super impressed. If you’ve been ignoring it, stop.” - John Nunemaker, Programmer/Owner, Box Out Sports

“We ran a user study to understand the security of code written by 58 student programmers when guided by LLMs—half of the students using GitHub Copilot and the other half without. In this small study of student programmers, we found that students with AI assistance were more likely to write functional code—and we did not find a statistically significant impact on security.” - Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, Assistant Professor at NYU Tandon (provided an approved quote based on this research)

“The tool could revolutionize coding education, style and workplace practices. Making it general access moves it one step closer to becoming mainstream in the workplace.” - Lizzy Lawrence, Reporter, Protocol

DRI: [Legal]
        Yes.
GitHub Copilot Customer Availability FAQ
## Who can purchase GitHub Copilot for Business?
  
 GitHub Copilot for Business is generally available as of February 2023. Any business can purchase GitHub Copilot for Business and, depending on their GitHub account type, is given the option to pay using invoice, Azure billing, or credit card. Customers must agree to the GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms.




## Can my customer purchase GitHub Copilot for Business if they cannot transmit data outside of their country (not in the U.S.)? 
  
## See What data does Copilot for Business collect?


Customers should conduct their own legal review to ensure GitHub Copilot meets their specific requirements. CfB handles and keeps User Engagement Data in the United States. For more details on what User Engagement Data entails and how GitHub uses it,
see UED Processing Purpose 


## Can GitHub Copilot for Business be enabled for outside collaborators?
  
No.
## Will GitHub Copilot for Business work with EMU-enabled Enterprise Accounts?
  
Yes.
## Can GitHub Enterprise Server customers manage GitHub Copilot for Business licenses in GitHub Enterprise Server?
  
GitHub Copilot assigns licenses to users with GitHub.com accounts. For GHES customers on a Unified SKU only, they would be able to use Connect to synchronize user accounts between GHES and GHEC or create a GHEC instance and manage those accounts separately.
## Does GitHub Copilot for Business require the customer to host their code on GitHub?
  
No. Customers can host their code anywhere and still use GitHub Copilot for Business provided their users have GitHub.com accounts (or accounts provisioned in an EMU-enabled Enterprise Account) and a supported IDE.
## Do customers need to enable GitHub Connect to use GitHub Copilot for Business with GHES? 
  
  No, Connect does not need to be turned on in order to use GitHub Copilot for Business. However, the requirement is that the end user has a dotcom account and the admin manages their seat license on GitHub.com, so Connect is a good mechanism to get GHES users to have dotcom accounts.


## Is GitHub Copilot for Business available for all regions? 
  
💰GitHub Copilot follows trade and compliance rules that mean it's available in most countries, but not all. To learn more about GitHub and its trade controls generally, please see https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls


## Is there any way for a company to see which users are consuming a CfI license?
  
No. There is no way for an organization to tell which users have CfI licenses. That agreement is between the user and GitHub. Much like any tool, moderation and restriction of that is an employer issue.


GitHub Copilot Billing & Usage FAQ 
## Are users billed based on active usage or based on assigned seats? 
  
 Customers are billed by assigned seats, regardless of the user’s active usage. In other words, if the user has been assigned a GitHub Copilot for Business seat, we will still bill them even if the user is not actively using GitHub Copilot in their IDE.
## Are the licenses floating or use specific? / Can you reassign the seats?
  
No licenses are required since customers are billed based on seat assignments from the Enterprise Admin. When a GitHub Copilot seat is assigned to an end user, the admin has a 15-minute grace period to remove a user before being charged for the remainder of their monthly bill period. However, if a user installs the GitHub Copilot for Business extension and tries to generate a token, the grace period ends. Seat cannot be transferred to another user mid-term.
## Do seats of GitHub Copilot need to be pre-purchased? Or can they just pay when the engineers install it at an individual level?
  
No. GitHub Copilot for Business does not need to be pre-purchased. Seats can be added/removed each month, and the business only pays for seats that have been assigned.
## Does GitHub Copilot seats need to be 1:1 with the number of GHEC seats? ?
  
Yes, CfB seats need to be a 1:1 match to GHEC licenses.. Essentially, the customer needs a GHEC license for each user assigned to CfB.
## Is GitHub Copilot for Business billed against total metered spending limits??
  
 No, GitHub Copilot for Business is separately invoiced and does not count against total metered spending limits.

One way to artificially create a spending limit:
   * 1. Create an Org or Team used specifically for assigning Copilot licenses.
   * 2. Configure Copilot to automatically assign licenses to everyone in that Org.
   * 3. Only give one person Admin permissions for the Org. Ideally, this would be the person responsible for the budget.
   * 4. Now you have total control over spending!

Keep in mind that Copilot isn't restricted to being used within an Org or Repo. Because it uses context from the code editor, Copilot can be used anywhere (once you have a license).




## Can a MSFT customer with Azure discount apply the discount to GitHub Copilot for Business?
  


Yes, a MSFT customer with an Azure Commitment Discount (ACD) can apply this discount to their Copilot for Business consumption when they invoice this consumption under their Azure Subscription ID. This can be done by associating a customer's Azure Subscription ID to their GitHub Enterprise Cloud environment. Detailed instructions found here (https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-billing-for-your-github-account/connecting-an-azure-subscription-to-your-enterprise).

Are customers able to use pre-paid Azure credits for purchasing GitHub 
## Copilot for Business?
  
 No, GitHub customers wouldn’t be able to use Azure Credits for GitHub metered services, including GitHub Copilot for Business.
## What are the steps for MSFT EA customers that are using ADO to purchase CfB? Do they need just that 1 GHEC license?
  
 At this time, MSFT EA customers that wish to pay via Azure subscription will need to purchase a GHEC license for each CfB user. In early Q4, MSFT EA customers will have the option to sign-up for a Free-Org or Team Plan subscription and pay via Azure subscription.
## Can Azure Credit Offerings (ACOs) be used to pay for CfB?
  
No, CfB is not Monetary Commit (MC) eligible and therefore ACOs cannot be used to pay for CfB.


Are customers able to use pre-paid Azure credits for purchasing GitHub
## Copilot for Business?
  
No, GitHub customers are not able to use Azure Credits for GitHub metered services, including GitHub Copilot for Business.
## Can customers who are on MSFT EA provide us an open PO for consumption or prepay?
  
 MSFT EA customers will need to pay for GitHub Copilot for Business through their Azure subscription consistent with any other Azure products and services.
## At the moment, GitHub Copilot license assignment is scoped at the org-level. Do we have any plans to move that into the enterprise-level? 
  
Billing for users is aggregated at the enterprise level. Consequently, anyone assigned a license in two orgs will only be billed for one license. We do not plan to offer enterprise license administration at this time.
## If a customer has two GitHub enterprise accounts, one on a MSFT EA and the other purchased directly from GitHub, can the customer purchase GitHub Copilot for Business using the Azure billing ID from the MSFT EA and then use GitHub Copilot in their GitHub direct purchased enterprise as well?
  
 Yes.


## If a customer has Premium Plus support does the $19 / month GitHub Copilot cost also incur the associated fee for Premium Plus?
  
 GitHub Copilot for Business will be treated the same as other consumption based products (Actions, Packages, etc.), and would not be included in the license cost used to calculate Premium Plus fee.
## Are the pricing and billing terms included in the terms the Admins accept as part of the set up process? 
  
 No, the GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms do not alter existing  pricing or billing terms.




## What are the steps to accept the terms of GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Labs?
  
 The terms for GitHub Copilot and for pre-release products (Copilot Labs, Copilot X, and so on) are separate. For most enterprises, the terms for GitHub Copilot are already included in your contract, and become effective when you begin using the service. In addition, when an admin enables GitHub Copilot for the enterprise, there is a reminder notice regarding the Copilot terms. Pre-release products are intended to be experimental in nature, so things might break occasionally. The features that appear in GitHub Copilot Labs are not of GA quality, and may never become generally available. We also collect both more and different telemetry compared to the generally available Copilot product. To use pre-release products such as GitHub Copilot Labs, individual users will need to sign up and accept the GitHub Copilot Pre-Release Terms. Separately, an admin will need to accept the same Copilot Pre-Release Terms on behalf of the enterprise; this is done via DocuSign.
## How can customers with another SCM buy Copilot? Hypothetically, couldn’t a GitLab/BitBucket customer just create a Team account and get GitHub Copilot without buying Enterprise?
  
 Yes, a GitLab or BitBucket customer could use a free or teams organization to get access to GitHub Copilot for Business. They don't need to buy GitHub Enterprise.




## What about the GitHub Copilot lawsuit?
  
GitHub Copilot is a groundbreaking, paradigm-shifting innovation that we've already seen massively increases developer productivity and happiness. It's not uncommon or unexpected to see some level of litigation around this type of innovation. We welcome the continued conversation and the opportunity to defend technologies that benefit developers and the world as a whole.


Customer Data
## Is my source code secure despite the telemetry?
  
GitHub Copilot for Business does not access the source code in your editor other than to generate the Prompt that is transmitted to the model securely. Once generated and returned, your Suggestions are not retained.


## Can customers and admins get reporting for users who have been using Copilot and users who haven't during a time period?
  
The Access page where admins assign/revoke Copilot licenses includes a column for "date of last activity" for each user.


We recently published our Copilot for Business User Management API (beta): https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-for-business?apiVersion=2022-11-28 that admins can utilize today. On the Access page, admins can also leverage the Get Report button to obtain a CSV with user activity (last token refresh). Admins could also leverage our new Audit Log support to understand when users were given a license.


GitHub Copilot Human Oversight FAQ
## Is there a diagram or outline that describes how context works?
  
No. We cannot specify too much.




## Could GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code into its suggestions?
  
 Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. This is something we care a lot about at GitHub, and in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. 


Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.


More on GitHub Copilot’s always-on security filter for Suggestions: 


https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/
## Does GitHub own the code generated by GitHub Copilot?
  
No, GitHub does not own the code generated (what we call "Suggestions"). In Section 2 of the GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms, we expressly disclaim any ownership in Suggestions.
## Does GitHub Copilot copy code from the training set?
  
GitHub Copilot’s Suggestions are all generated through AI. GitHub Copilot generates new code in a probabilistic way, and the probability that they produce the same code as a snippet that occurred in training is low. The models do not contain a database of code, and they do not ‘look up’ snippets.


Our latest internal research shows that about 1% of the time, a Suggestion may contain some code snippets longer than ~150 characters that matches the training set.


Previous research showed that many of these cases happen when GitHub Copilot is unable to glean sufficient context from the code you are writing, or when there is a common, perhaps even universal, solution to the problem. 
## What can I do to reduce GitHub Copilot’s suggestion of code that matches public code?
  
We built a filter to help detect and suppress GitHub Copilot suggestions which contain code that matches public code on GitHub.
 
GitHub Copilot for Individual users have the choice to enable that filter during setup on their individual accounts. For GitHub Copilot for Business users, the Enterprise administrator controls how the filter is applied. They can control suggestions for all organizations or defer control to individual organization administrators. These organization administrators can turn the filter on or off during setup (assuming their Enterprise administrator has deferred control) for the users in their organization.


With the filter enabled, GitHub Copilot checks code suggestions with its surrounding code for matches or near matches (ignoring whitespace) against public code on GitHub of about 150 characters. If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.


In addition, we have announced that we are building a feature that will provide a reference for suggestions that resemble public code on GitHub so that you can make a more informed decision about whether or not to use that code, as well as explore and learn how that code is used in other projects.


Just like when you write any code that uses material you did not independently originate, you should take precautions to understand how it works and ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities. You should make sure your IDE or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it. Please see this blog: Introducing code referencing for GitHub Copilot


## Other than the filter, what other measures can I take to assess code suggested by GitHub Copilot?
  
You should take the same precautions as you would with any code you write that uses material you did not independently originate, and should take precautions to ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities. You should make sure your IDE or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.


GitHub Copilot Fairness and Broader Impact FAQ
## Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?
  
Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will probably perform less suitably in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.
## Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?
  
 We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum. This video showcases GitHub’s current advancements around accessibility. GitHub Copilot X does provide voice support, which can be a powerful tool to help developers with disabilities. We believe voice support in GitHub Copilot X has accessibility benefits.
## Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?
  
GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.
## How will advanced code generation tools like GitHub Copilot affect developer jobs? 
  
Bringing in more intelligent systems has the potential to bring enormous change to the developer experience. We do not expect GitHub Copilot to replace developers. Rather, we expect GitHub Copilot to partner with developers, augment their capabilities, and enable them to be more productive, reduce manual tasks, and help them focus on interesting work. We also believe that GitHub Copilot has the potential to lower barriers to entry, enabling more people to explore software development, and join the next generation of developers. We are working to test these hypotheses with both internal and external research.
## Will GitHub Copilot take away developer jobs?
  
 If the past is any indication, new developer tools help augment and not substitute for developers. Just as, for example, compilers and new programming languages brought change for developers’ workflows, these changes have been positive and empowered them to do more. We’re not content to rest on history, however: we’re supporting research, both internal and external, to understand these broader effects of GitHub Copilot and future AI-powered developer tools.

GitHub Copilot Privacy – General FAQ
## Will my code be shared with other users?
  
No. We follow responsible practices in accordance with our Privacy Statement to ensure that neither your Prompts or Suggestions will be shared or used as suggested code for other users of GitHub Copilot.


## Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?
  



While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code, which occasionally contained personal data. Although it's rare, there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. However, these suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. We've implemented filters to catch and block identifiable information, especially emails, but it's an ongoing process of refinement.


  
For more information on how GitHub processes and uses personal data, please see the GitHub Privacy Statement.


## Does OpenAI or GitHub make use of a GitHub Copilot user’s private code to train Codex?
  
No. Neither GitHub nor OpenAI uses your private code to train OpenAI’s models, nor does OpenAI have any access to your private code.Your private code can never be used as suggested code for other users of GitHub Copilot. 
## What if I’m accused of copyright infringement based on using a GitHub Copilot suggestion? 
  
GitHub will defend you as provided in the GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms. 


## What information is included in “User Engagement Data (UED)” and how does GitHub use UED (what are the processing purposes)?
  
DRI: [Privacy]
GitHub’s Copilot User Engagement Data (UED) is information about how a user interacts with the Copilot extension. All UED contains a pseudonymous identifier - a unique, persistent identifier generated by GitHub - together with information about the user's interactions with the GitHub Service. We call these interactions events. User Engagement Data does not contain customer content. UED contains events like the ones listed here:


      * Authorization - Verification of a user’s GitHub Copilot for Business subscription. Examples include login failure, invalid token, new token, token refreshed.
      * Log - Evidence that an error occurred in the extension, but does not include error messages or stack traces.
      * Networking - Logs related to network issues between the server and the client. Examples include cancellation due to a network disconnect.
      * Prompt - Logging of scenarios that cause the prompt to be rejected. Examples include filtering rejections.


Processing purposes and roles


GitHub process UED as a data processor on behalf of our customers (the data controllers) for the following purposes:


      * To deliver functional capabilities as licensed, configured, and used by Customer and its users, including providing personalized user experiences;
      * Troubleshooting (preventing, detecting, and repairing problems); and
      * Ensuring the GitHub Copilot for Business service is secure, reliable, performant, up to date, and is enhancing user productivity by providing quality Suggestions.


Subject to authorization through GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement (DPA), GitHub processes UED as a data controller only for the following purposes:


      * Billing and account management
      * Compensation, such as calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
      * Aggregated internal reporting and business modeling, such as forecasting, revenue, capacity planning, and product strategy
      * Aggregated financial reporting


For both its controller and processor roles, GitHub applies the principles of data minimization.
## Does GitHub assign a unique identifier to each user's data?
  
DRI: [Copilot Eng]
Yes. GitHub Copilot employs pseudonymization techniques to protect the end user data we collect, which we refer to as "User Engagement Data." Each GitHub Copilot user is assigned a unique identifier (ID), ensuring that individual identities cannot be directly linked to the data. The correlation between the ID and the end user is known only to GitHub, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.


## At what level of granularity is personal data be pseudonymized? Is the user engagement data anonymized before it's processed?
  
DRI: [Privacy]
User Engagement Data is pseudonymized by assigning a GitHub ID that only GitHub can use to map back to the end user. The data is not anonymized prior to processing (hence the reference to pseudonymized identifiers)

GitHub Copilot OS Licenses FAQ
## What if I am accused of non-compliance with an OS license based on using a GitHub Copilot suggestion?
See response relating to GitHub Copilot terms. 


Using GitHub Copilot for Business for Secure Development
## Can GitHub Copilot make suggestions that introduce security vulnerabilities or malware? How can I make sure that the code I create using GitHub Copilot is secure?
  
While our experiments have shown that GitHub Copilot suggests code of the same or better quality than the average developer, we can’t give any assurance that the code is bug free. Like any programmer, GitHub Copilot may sometimes suggest insecure code. We recommend taking the same precautions you take with the code written by your engineers (linting, code scanning, IP scanning, etc.)
## What measures does GitHub Copilot use to reduce or eliminate security vulnerabilities or malware?
  
GitHub Copilot has an AI model that filters out some insecure code suggestions, but this is not a substitute for secure software development practices. We recommend taking the same precautions you take with the code written by your engineers (linting, code scanning, IP scanning, etc.).
## Can GitHub Copilot for Business be used with existing security automation tools?
  
Absolutely! MITRE, for example, is already using GitHub Copilot today to assist with InSpec specification development.

Competition


## What products is it competitive with? 
  
GitHub Copilot is at the frontier of using large language models (LLMs) trained on huge amounts of public text and code to enhance developer productivity, and the software industry as a whole is at the very beginning of learning to leverage large-scale machine learning models trained on Internet content in production software.  




## How does GitHub Copilot compare to ChatGPT?
  

Unlike ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot is optimized for code completion, and allows developers to stay focused on the task at-hand by bringing contextualized answers directly into the code editor. Developers can request code completions via both natural language (e.g. code comments) and code. Although GitHub Copilot can produce natural language suggestions, the model biases for code suggestions.


GitHub Copilot is built using a combination of models from OpenAI, Microsoft, and GitHub. A representative, but not comprehensive list includes:
      * Sahara, a GPT-3.5 model, is the LLM that provides suggestions. We use a custom version of the model to optimize for performance, suggestion quality, and scale.
      * Azure RAI provides models to filter slurs, slander, and hate speech
      * GitHub provides additional models to improve the quality (security) of suggestions, optimize for responsiveness in the code editor, etc.


ChatGPT is a general purpose chat client that produces content based on natural language commands. Because it’s based on the same model and training data used for GitHub Copilot, it can produce code suggestions, but doesn’t necessarily bias for code – so developers need to craft their prompt carefully to get helpful results. Also because it’s not integrated with a code editor, ChatGPT requires developers to shift their focus to a separate application window, breaking context.


User interaction is another key differentiator in understanding which use cases each tool better addresses. ChatGPT requires context switching to the “conversation” formatted prompt whereas GitHub Copilot operates entirely within the developer’s IDE. Additionally, while both tools accept natural language prompts through queries/code comments, GitHub Copilot will include additional context from the user’s IDE, such code in the current and other open files, to tailor suggestions to the user’s codebase whereas ChatGPT cannot because it operates in a separate application window from the IDE. Anecdotal feedback has suggested that ChatGPT lends itself to ideation and framing skeletons of new projects, where GitHub Copilot promotes developer flow to accelerate development on those skeletons or existing codebases. 


Here’s OpenAI’s blog post on ChatGPT (see “Limitations”).


Note: 
GitHub Copilot Chat is a chat interface that lets you interact with GitHub Copilot, to ask and receive answers to coding-related questions from directly within a supported IDE. The chat interface provides access to coding information and support without requiring you to navigate documentation or search online forums. Copilot Chat is currently supported in Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio. 


Public beta access to GitHub Copilot chat is being offered to a limited set of customers before general availability.Click here for the public beta waitlist. 


## How does GitHub Copilot compare to OpenAI?
GitHub Copilot is built on OpenAI Codex - a descendant of GPT-3; its training data contains both natural language and billions of lines of source code from publicly available sources, including code in public GitHub repositories.


GPT-3’s main skill is generating natural language in response to a natural language prompt, meaning the only way it affects the world is through the mind of the reader. OpenAI Codex has much of the natural language understanding of GPT-3, but it produces working code.


OpenAI Codex is a general-purpose programming model, meaning that it can be applied to essentially any programming task (though results may vary).


Source: https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex
 
## How does GitHub Copilot compare to Azure OpenAI?
  
 Azure OpenAI is an API that can be used to build applications (like chat apps) using OpenAI models. GitHub Copilot integrates API calls seamlessly into the editor so that users don’t have to make API calls themselves - and is focused on code responses rather than general solutions.


## What context shall we provide to customers who ask about our plans to adopt newer GPT versions?
  

There's a big, bold world of new ideas circulating out there. OpenAI provides the best blend of model quality, latency, cost, and consistency so far, but we can't and won't limit ourselves to a single vendor/model. Over time, we expect the “best models” to look even more diverse, and task-specific than they are today.


Different use cases will require different optimizations. We already use different OpenAI models for different use cases in the Copilot service (e.g. chat vs. code completion). It's very likely that other models will prove better optimized for new, specialized use cases as we expand Copilot to serve more parts of the software development lifecycle. We are actively experimenting with new models for new user interaction models, and will continue to evaluate new technologies as they become available.


Today, the in-market product uses a customized version of GPT 3.5-turbo because it provides the highest quality suggestions with lowest latency. Other models (e.g. GPT-4) may sometimes provide more robust suggestions, but they also incur higher latency. When a developer is in-the-flow and just trying to get their thoughts out into the editor quickly, low latency is often preferable to higher token counts. Sometimes, you just need something that works fast (<400ms).


Long story short: we use the right tool for the job, and we know it's the right tool because we measure developer behavior through things like the suggestion acceptance rate.


## (Buy vs Build) Why should a business purchase GitHub Copilot for Business over building their own Copilot-like coding assistant?


  

LLMs are pretty amazing. In fact, anyone can create a pretty good demo of a Copilot clone using any one of several publicly available LLMs in just a few weeks. Creating a "wow" demo is easy. The hard part is building a service that consistently returns good results in a wide variety of use cases at-scale.


When we first launched Copilot a little over 2 years ago, we had a 20% suggestion acceptance rate. It was only through experimentation, focus, and a lot of good data science that we've improved service quality over time. Now, we have a 35% acceptance rate leading to 46% of new code being written by Copilot.


If someone wants to build a Copilot clone, they can do it. It's only software. Just don't expect it to be as simple as hooking an LLM API up to a listener in the IDE. The Copilot team is over 60 data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, designers, and PMs (and we're arguably understaffed). Building a service that consistently returns good results in a wide variety of use cases at-scale is hard. It takes time, focus, talent, infrastructure, and service volume to conduct the experiments that enable continuous improvement.


We intentionally priced Copilot at a low, affordable cost because we want it to be broadly accessible. If organizations are making a "build it" decision based on cost, they may want to double-check the total cost of ownership.


In the end, ngineering teams typically choose GitHub Copilot over raw OpenAI APIs because Copilot:


      1. Integrates with the IDE (no context-switching)
      2. Does the work for you to create prompts that consistently returns good results.
      3. Scrubs suggestions of common security vulnerabilities, thereby increasing code quality
      4. Scrubs suggestions of matches with public code, thereby mitigating concerns of IP intrusion
      5. Provides indemnification against 3rd party claims of code ownership
      6. Is a SaaS with a roadmap tailor-made for developer productivity.


This is a long way of saying: Copilot is not just the models. The architecture is multiple services and IDE-integrations layered on top of each other to deliver a developer productivity tool.


Microsoft FAQ on the GPT-3 model
## How are you avoiding the dangers known to be associated with these models?
  
Both Microsoft and OpenAI have a rigorous governance process to ensure approved uses of our language models meet strict safety and ethical guidelines. You can read more about Microsoft’s process at The building blocks of Microsoft’s responsible AI program. 
## Will these advancements and applications of AI replace jobs?
  
Our purpose for investing in the advancement of AI is to empower people, whether that’s augmenting their skills or assisting with tasks. That said, history has taught us that any major technological advancement is likely to disrupt or eliminate some jobs, while at the same time creating new ones, and we expect that to be true with AI. That’s why Microsoft is leveraging its position as a leading global technology company to develop technological solutions, make strategic investments through its global skills initiative in skills development and employability programs to address the skills gap and lead by example as we work to ensure that this industrial revolution and the technology driving it, creates economic opportunity for all.
## Tech companies have more money and resources than most others which seems like it’s creating an unfair advantage for others who don’t have the ability to create or directly access large language models. What do you say to this?
  
Building, deploying, and maintaining large models requires a significant investment of resources and Microsoft is fortunate that we have the ability to invest in this space. That is why we’re committed to working with OpenAI to make large language models available through our products and new scenarios, while being mindful of the safety measures needed to avoid intended or unintended misuse or abuse. We’re working quickly to deploy Large Language Models (LLM) into our products, like seen in Power Platform, so that customers can leverage the power of AI. OpenAI also makes the model available to developers through their API. 
## Why don’t you just make the technology, like the GPT models, available for anyone who wants to use it?
  
There is a real concern around the potential malicious use of these models that we need to consider which is why we and OpenAI are being very thoughtful in our approach to making the models available.

OpenAI (under Language Models) https://openai.com/api/pricing/


Microsoft Azure OpenAI Services (in Preview)
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/
## Why are you integrating Large Language Models into your products?
  
GPT-4 is one of the biggest and most advanced AI models available today. Given our partnership, we have an incredible opportunity to expand our Azure-powered AI platform in a way that democratizes AI technology, enables new products, services, and experiences, and increases the positive impact of AI at Scale.


## Is Microsoft giving GPT-series access to customers and/or charging for it?
  
Launched in June 2021, GitHub Copilot was the world’s first “Copilot.” It uses large language models to assist developers with coding tasks. Microsoft is also bringing large language models to virtually every product in their portfolio. For example, Microsoft has announced “Copilots” for M365, Power Apps, Dynamics, and more. For customers who want to integrate large language models into their own products, Microsoft offers Azure OpenAI Services.

      2. GitHub Copilot is intended to provide developers with increased focus, flow, and productivity. While GitHub Copilot enjoys a 35% average suggestion acceptance rate (compared to 14-17% for ""normal"" auto-complete), not every suggestion will be perfect or bug-free. You still need thinking, breathing, reasoning developers on the other side of the keyboard exercising good judgment. Enterprises should continue to apply reasonable coding policies and industry standard practices as they would with any code their developers don’t independently originate.
      3. GitHub Copilot is probabilistic and not deterministic. While it can nudge your developers toward better quality code, it is not the right tool for enforcing policy, style guides, etc. You should continue to use linting tools, code reviews, branch protections, etc. for policy enforcement.
## [M]Does GitHub Copilot for Business work in air-gapped environments?
  
No. GitHub Copilot for Business requires an active internet connection between a user’s IDE and the GitHub Copilot Proxy service as per the request routing docs here.
## [M]Do we have plans to log synthesized suggestions, the user they were sent to, and whether they were accepted or not? Perhaps as part of the audit log?
  
 No, we don’t provide that level of detail today.
## [M]Can customers configure their firewalls to allow connectivity to GitHub Copilot for Business specifically? 
  
Yes. Customers can finetune their network traffic using the URLs listed in the documentation article Troubleshooting firewall settings for GitHub Copilot.
## What firewall configuration do customers need to make to allow connectivity to GitHub Copilot Chat?
  
 Customers with firewalls must add the hostnames listed here in the docs to their firewall allowlist to ensure connectivity to GitHub Copilot Chat. On February 1, 2024, we will deprecate the “proxy” endpoint for Copilot Chat. To ensure Copilot Chat continues working after February 1, 2024, customers must update to the most recent version of the Copilot extension and ensure their firewall and network settings allow communication to https://api.githubcopilot.com.


## [M]Can the GitHub Copilot extension for VSCode work behind a CIDR block? 
  
No, GitHub Copilot only provides public endpoints for networking filters.

The same proxy configuration setting is available for other GitHub Copilot IDE extensions:
      * Jetbrains


## [G]Is there a dedicated version of GitHub Copilot for Business that I can connect to via my own network? 
  
No. However, private cloud inferencing which would provide for this type of isolated tenant for GitHub Copilot for Business is being looked at as a potential capability in the future.


## [G]Is there a public API for GitHub Copilot for Business?
  
We recently published our Copilot for Business User Management API (beta): https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-for-business?apiVersion=2022-11-28. 


## [G]🆕 Will we build an Analytics Dashboard to help customers quantify the impact GitHub Copilot makes on developers' code writing? Eg. % suggestions accepted.
We will first start by providing this data through an API before progressing to a dashboard. Expect to see the API early 2024.




## [M]Does GitHub support a customer's ability to route Copilot data through a proxy?
  
GitHub supports HTTP proxies including ones using TLS/SSL interception for Copilot for Business. If necessary an explicit proxy can be configured using the instructions for the appropriate editor, for example see here for Visual Studio Code. We do not document or support the specific format of the messages GitHub Copilot uses to communicate with the service, and all responsibility and liability related to TLS/SSL interception usage rests entirely on our customers.


## [M Do you have separate production and non-production environments?
  
DRI: [Security], [Copilot Eng]
GitHub is an Agile/DevSecOps environment, building GitHub on GitHub following the “GitHub Flow”, published here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow 


Multiple procedures, guidelines, and instructional documents cover every aspect of our development process, however, these are restricted to internal use only under GitHub's Data Classification standard. For an overview of how changes are published to our live environment, see:


      * https://github.blog/2015-06-02-deploying-branches-to-github-com/
      * https://github.blog/2012-08-29-deploying-at-github/


## [G]What is the expertise of your employees developing and monitoring the solution?
  
DRI: [Legal], [Compliance]
GitHub personnel are industry leaders who have been involved in all aspects of the Copilot service's development, release, iteration, and monitoring since technical preview release in 2021.


## [M]Do you have processes to control availability and unauthorized or accidental destruction of data?
  
DRI: [Copilot Prod], [Copilot Eng]
Copilot for Business is a non-destructive service accessed through the editor. Users decide whether to accept or reject a Copilot suggestion. Should a suggestion be mistakenly deleted, users can employ the standard editor 'undo' function to restore the suggestion (or any other deleted code).


## [G]Can Copilot abuse filtering be disabled by a customer?
  
DRI: [Copilot Eng], [Security]
No, abuse filtering capabilities cannot be disabled. To recap on the filters that are applied:


GitHub Copilot inspects Prompts for:
      * Toxicity: hate speech, sexual content, violence, and evidence of self-harm
      * Relevancy (chat only): an intent classifier ensures the service only responds to questions about code and software development
      * Prompt hacking (chat only): the service detects and blocks attempts to trick the model into returning service internals


GitHub Copilot inspects Suggestions for:


      * Toxicity: hate speech, sexual content, violence, and evidence of self-harm
      * Unique identifiers: email address, GitHub URL, IP Address, and hard-coded credentials
      * Code quality: common security vulnerabilities like, but not limited to SQL injection, path injection, code injection, clear text logging, incomplete URL sanitization, hardcoded credentials, weak cryptographic algorithms, etc.
      * Matches with public code (optional): suggestions over 150 characters (ignoring whitespace) are compared against an index of public code.


[M]All remote access connections to Third Party internal networks and / or computer systems will require authorisation with access control at the point of entry using multi-factor authentication. Such access will use secure channels, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
  
DRI: [Security], [Copilot Eng] 
GitHub does not require remote access to customer systems to provide the GitHub Copilot service. Customers use client software (editor extensions for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ and Vim as required) to make outbound connections over https to the Copilot service.

## What security measures are in place to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged between Copilot and third-party systems?
  
When transferring data to third party systems, GitHub takes reasonable technical, operational and contractual measures necessary to protect customer data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of your personal data.


## What cloud computing services do you use for Copilot infrastructure? Server based (EC2) or severless (containers)?
  
DRI: [Copilot Eng] [Security]
Copilot operates in a high availability environment deploying container-based services built on a diverse mix of data center and network suppliers.


Troubleshooting
My customer is seeing this message while trying to activate GitHub Copilot on EMUs
  

Assuming the diagnosis is accurate, then the wording could be cleaned up to be more definitive, like "The customer is trying to subscribe to GitHub Copilot for Individuals, which is not available to EMU accounts. They should instead contact their administrator to sign them up for GitHub Copilot for Business."


There appears to have been various discussion about improving the message which was never closed out, see https://github.com/github/copilot/issues/4509 and https://github.com/github/github/pull/255484 - finishing that work would remove the need for a FAQ entry at all. 
GitHub Copilot Configuration and Model Customizations
## When will the code referencing feature be available and what will it do? 
  
The code referencing feature is currently available in Private Preview for code completions in Visual Studio Code (link). It identifies suggestions that contain exact matches with public code and if located, provides a log that includes links to repositories for any matching code, along with any available metadata such as applicable public licenses. GitHub Copilot users can review this information to determine whether GitHub Copilot’s code suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use such suggestions.


## Can I prevent code written in GitHub Copilot for Business from being committed to specific repos?
  
Not at this time. There is significant complexity involved in implementing something like this with little customer demand at the moment. Feedback is certainly welcome from customers.


The code suggested and accepted is viewed like any line of code a developer would add manually. This is why it is important to work on your code with the same principles and workflow than before GitHub Copilot:
               * Write tests (GitHub Copilot can help)
               * Automate as much as possible in CI
               * Put the PR/Code review as the center of the collaboration


## Can I exclude portions of GitHub Copilot for Business’s dataset?
  
This is currently not an option.
## Can I train GitHub Copilot for Business on my own data set?
  
No, This is currently not available, although it may be possible in the future. No public announcements nor timelines at this point.


## How do I view GitHub Copilot usage information for my organization?
  
GitHub Copilot for Business shows usage information to organization and enterprise administrators. 


For billing related usage, users can find more in our documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/viewing-your-github-copilot-usage.

GitHub Copilot Chat limited public beta
General 
## What is GitHub Copilot Chat beta? 
  
GitHub Copilot Chat beta provides a natural language chat interface to engage with GitHub Copilot, an AI developer tool or “AI pair programmer,” and get coding information and support for tasks from explaining code to finding issues and fixing them. It draws context from the developer’s IDE or editor to provide these answers easily in a convenient place. The beta release currently supports Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code and is available to all GitHub Copilot for Business subscribers and invited GitHub Copilot for Individuals users.  
## How do I get access to GitHub Copilot Chat beta? 
  
You will need to be a current subscriber to GitHub Copilot for Individuals or GitHub Copilot for Business, which you may read more about here: https://github.com/features/copilot


Copilot for Individuals: You’ll need to join the waitlist and receive an invite to get access to Copilot Chat beta. An active or trial subscription to Copilot for Individuals does not guarantee an invite to test the feature. We will do our best to accommodate without specific timelines to provide access in place. 


Copilot for Business: Enterprise and organization administrators can offer access to this beta to their development teams with the following steps: 


               1. Navigate to Copilot Policies in Settings: 
               * For enterprise administrators: in Settings, visit “Copilot” under the “Policies” tab.
               * For organization administrators: in Settings, visit “Policies” under the "Copilot" tab.
               2. Locate the Copilot Chat beta policy: Configure the setting for Copilot Chat beta for the enterprise or organization.
               3. Accept the terms and conditions: To enable Copilot Chat beta for all users, admins need to accept the terms and conditions. This can be done by selecting the option "Allowed."


Here is the detailed description of how these administrator settings work - 
               1. GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) enterprise administrators can let either the organization administrators choose the setting for their organizations or they can choose a setting to be enforced across all their organizations. Enterprise administrators have three options - 
               1. No Policy - It is up to the organization administrators to set policy for enabling Copilot Chat beta
               2. Allowed - If enterprise administrators set this setting, then all the organizations and their users within that enterprise get access to Copilot Chat beta 
               3. Blocked - If enterprise administrators set this setting, then all the organizations and their users within that enterprise will be blocked from accessing Copilot Chat beta
               2. Organizations administrators within an enterprise would have to follow the settings set up by their enterprise administrators
               1. If the enterprise admin has chosen “No Policy,” then organization admins will have to select either “Allowed” or “Blocked” to grant or block access to Copilot Chat beta to users within their organizations
               2. If either “Allowed” or “Blocked” was chosen by the enterprise admin, then organization administrators will not be able to change the setting at the organization level but would be able to view what was chosen by the enterprise administrators       
               3. Organization admins with no enterprise administrators will have to either choose “Allowed” or “Blocked” to grant or block access to Copilot Chat beta.


Once an enterprise or organization administrator accepts the terms by selecting “Allowed,” all users within the organization will receive an email containing detailed installation instructions to help them begin their journey with Copilot Chat beta.


## How will I know if I have been accepted in the beta? 
  
On acceptance into the GitHub Copilot Chat beta program, you will receive an email at the email address associated with the GitHub handle you used to request access. This email will provide you with installation instructions and outline the subsequent steps.


Users enrolled in the Copilot for Individuals plan who have joined the waitlist, besides receiving an email notification, can also visit the waitlist page to verify their status and determine if they have access to Copilot. 
 
## After being accepted, what should I do to begin using the beta? 
  
## Please follow the instructions provided in the welcome email carefully regarding the installation process. If you encounter any installation issues, please refer to the question: What should I do if I encounter authentication errors? 


After successfully completing the installation process, you can refer to our documentation to gain a better understanding of how to utilize chat functionality. 
 
## Which editors support GitHub Copilot Chat beta? 
  
GitHub Copilot Chat beta is currently supported in Visual Studio (Windows only) and Visual Studio Code. Note that Copilot Chat beta is not officially supported in beta or “Insiders” versions of these IDEs.


Visual Studio:
If you have been admitted from the beta waitlist or have been granted access through your administrator, you can use GitHub Copilot Chat beta in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5 and higher for Windows, by downloading Visual Studio Extension for GitHub Copilot beta. You’ll need to add the GitHub account that you were admitted from the waitlist on, to Visual Studio (instructions here).


Visual Studio Code:
If you have been admitted from the beta waitlist or have been granted access through your administrator, first make sure to update to the latest Visual Studio Code (version 1.80 and higher) and install the GitHub Copilot Chat extension. Copilot will show a notification to sign in with GitHub, at which time you need to make sure to sign in with the account that has Copilot access. 
## What should I do if I encounter authentication errors? 
  

Visual Studio:
               1. Check that your GitHub ID as used for signup for the beta is added to Visual Studio
               2. Check your GitHub ID/credentials don’t need refreshing in Visual Studio. If they do, refresh them and restart Visual Studio
               3. Try removing and re-adding your GitHub ID to Visual Studio and restarting Visual Studio.
               4. If the above steps don’t work, please report a problem


Visual Studio Code:
               1. Click VS Code’s Accounts icon to sign out of your GitHub account 
               2. Reload ("Use `F1` to open the Command Palette in VS Code and select the command "Developer: Reload Window" )
               3. Retry Sign-in after double-checking that your account has Copilot access.
               4. If the above steps don’t work, please report a problem
## How do I use GitHub Copilot Chat beta in my editor? 
  

Visual Studio:
               1. Chat Window - which is available under View…GitHub Copilot Chat (Ctrl+W, Ctrl+I on the keyboard)
               2. Inline editor input - right click on an active editor window and select “Ask Copilot” (Alt + / - or equivalent key on non English keyboards)


Visual Studio Code:
The main interfaces for having conversations with GitHub Copilot:
               1. Chat view: Chat icon in the Activity Bar, can also be moved to the editor area
               2. Inline chat: Open this for quick edits by right-clicking into a file and opening the Copilot context menu.
               3. GitHub Copilot can also be found in the refactor menu.


We continue to explore additional interfaces and entry points for GitHub Copilot in VS Code, so this list may continue to grow.

## How accurate are the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot Chat beta? 
  
The accuracy of suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot Chat beta can vary depending on several factors. GitHub Copilot is trained on a vast amount of publicly available code and aims to generate helpful and relevant suggestions based on that training. However, it's important to note that the suggestions are generated by an AI model thus may not align with your specific requirements.


The accuracy of suggestions can be influenced by factors such as the quality and clarity of the code context provided, the complexity of the task at hand, and the level of training and experience of the user. It's always a good practice to carefully review and test the suggestions before incorporating them into your codebase.


GitHub Copilot Chat beta is continuously being improved and refined based on user feedback, which helps enhance its accuracy over time. GitHub Copilot Chat beta can work as a tool to assist you in your coding process, albeit you still need to exercise your judgment and expertise to ensure the correctness and suitability of the generated code.
## What are the limitations of GitHub Copilot Chat beta? 
  
Depending on your scenario and input data, you could experience different levels of performance. While not limited specifically, GitHub Copilot Chat beta has limitations, which may include:


               * Potential inaccuracies and irrelevant suggestions
               * Lack of context awareness beyond the provided code context
               * Lack of deep domain knowledge or expertise in niche programming languages
               * Biases present in the training data that can influence the suggestions
               * The code suggestions can be rendered vulnerable due to vulnerabilities present in the training data


Users should be cautious of security and privacy concerns and avoid sharing sensitive information. It is important to exercise judgment, review suggestions, and ensure the generated code aligns with specific requirements and best practice.
## Where can I raise issues and bugs with GitHub Copilot Chat beta?

Privacy and Security
## What types of data does GitHub Copilot Chat beta use to provide the service? 
  
GitHub Copilot Chat beta uses three types of data to provide the service:


               1. User Engagement Data: User Engagement Data is data about user interactions with the service and overall usage data, which includes pseudonymous identifiers. A pseudonymous identifier is like a code name for a person. It's a privacy tool allowing data collection without directly linking it to a specific individual. 
               2. Contextual Prompts:  A Contextual Prompt is the combination of a summary of contextual information gleaned from the user as well as the question submitted in the chat interface
               3. Suggestions: A Suggestion is one or more lines of proposed text returned to the GitHub Copilot Chat beta extension after a Contextual Prompt is received and processed by the AI-model. It is the output provided by the chat system to answer a user's query or engage in a conversation with the user. 


## What data does GitHub use to create a Contextual Prompt? 
  
GitHub Copilot Chat beta creates a Contextual Prompt by combining (1) a “context summary” with (2) the question you submit to your editor. 


For instance, if you submit “what does this method do” the client for GitHub Copilot Chat beta will automatically gather context from your active documents in the editor to determine what you mean by the word “this.” It will then compose a suitable question to pose to the GitHub Copilot Chat beta model that automatically includes that selection, without you needing to copy and paste code into the chat window, saving you time and delivering a hopefully useful response.


Depending on the question you ask, the GitHub Copilot Chat beta client will automatically use appropriate aspects of your context to form the question. The information it uses may include:
               * The code file open in your active document
               * Your selection (or “code blocks for the current cursor position”) in the document
               * Summaries of related documents open in your editor or from the workspace
               * Information about errors/warnings/messages/exceptions in your error list
               * General workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies
               * Parts of related files in your workspace/project/repo


## Does GitHub Copilot Chat beta retain, collect or store data by default? 


  
The data handling details depend on whether you are using GitHub Copilot Chat beta as a GitHub Copilot for Business or GitHub Copilot for Individuals user and your settings if you are a Copilot for Individuals user. 


               * Contextual Prompts and Suggestions are not stored at rest for Copilot for Business users
               * If you use Copilot for Individuals, your Contextual Prompts and Suggestions from your interactions with Copilot Chat beta will be retained unless you’ve disabled such collection in your current Copilot settings 
               * User Engagement Data is collected and retained from all users, regardless of product type, for 2 years.
## How does GitHub use User Engagement Data to provide and improve the service? 


  
User Engagement Data is used by GitHub and Microsoft to provide and make improvements to the service, and to enable improvements to the user experience of the Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code extensions. Such uses may include:
               * Evaluating GitHub Copilot Chat beta, e.g., by measuring the positive impact it has on the user
               * Fine tuning ranking and sorting algorithms and Contextual Prompt crafting
               * Detecting potential abuse of GitHub Copilot Chat beta or violation of Acceptable Use Policies
               * Conducting experiments and research related to developers and their use of developer tools and services
## Does GitHub Copilot Chat beta use Contextual Prompts or Suggestions to train its Large Language Model (LLM) by default? 


  
No. For GitHub Copilot for Business users, GitHub does not store Contextual Prompts or Suggestions from use of Copilot Chat beta at rest and hence such data is not used to train models. For GitHub Copilot for Individual users, GitHub retains this data from use of Copilot Chat beta unless the user disablessuch collection in their current Copilot settings.

GitHub Copilot X Questions 
What happened and why? 
What's being 
announced?
	On Mar 22, 2023, we unveiled to the world GitHub Copilot X, the next generation of Copilot bringing AI across many steps of the developer lifecycle journey.
	What is it? 
	AI-powered auto-completion was just the starting point. Our R&D team at GitHub Next has been working to move past the editor and evolve GitHub Copilot into a readily accessible AI assistant throughout the entire development lifecycle. 
This is GitHub Copilot X—our vision for the future of AI-powered software development. We are not only adopting OpenAI’s new GPT-4 model, but are introducing chat and voice for Copilot, and bringing


Copilot to pull requests, the command line, and docs to answer questions on your projects.
	

Confirmed Naming 
	GitHub Copilot X
	Announcement Date 
	March 22nd, 2023
	Pricing and packaging 
What are the key 
features we are 
showing or making 
available?
	The availability of GitHub Copilot X is still being discussed. Currently, we don’t plan to ship these new GitHub Copilot X features as part of Copilot for Individuals or Copilot for Business but potentially as part of a new higher priced upcoming SKU. 
Therefore, when it comes to availability and pricing, we should say the following: GitHub Copilot X is currently a representation of GitHub’s vision for the future rather than an available product offering of GitHub Copilot. As we continue to design, test, and build features that fall into the GitHub Copilot X vision, we are also taking the time to determine the best way to provide them to our customers.

For Sellers (How are these features 
launching here helping sellers sell more? Think about the connection back to the Command of the Message value drivers (1. Accelerate high-quality software development and 
delivery. 2. Ship more secure software and 3. Improve organizational efficiency)
	GitHub Copilot X will accelerate developers’ productivity and bring more delight across more of the development lifecycle. Today, Copilot focuses on code generation within the code editor. GitHub Copilot X brings that delight into more areas of the developer experience, such as the CLI (command-line Interface), PRs (pull requests) and documentation. This infused AI across more steps of the development lifecycle will drastically improve developers productivity and happiness while developing. 
With AI available at every step, we can fundamentally redefine developer productivity. We are reducing boilerplate and manual tasks and making complex work easier across the developer lifecycle. By doing so, we’re enabling every developer to focus all their creativity on the big picture: building the innovation of tomorrow and accelerating human progress, today.
	Problems addressed and statement (What customer pain points is that solving?) 
	AI has the ability to accelerate developers productivity every step of the way through the software development lifecycle. Manual tasks can now be accelerated through AI beyond just code generation. Summarizing what a PR is doing, checking for errors in code and recommending fixes, asking for guidance on how to delete a branch or do an interactive rebase using the command line, all of this will now be a breeze thanks to AI on GitHub brought by GitHub Copilot X. 
	









## Risks & mitigation (Are we risking anything with this product launch or our go-to-market plan?) 
Assets to tell the world about this
	We believe the main question will be around pricing and availability. 
● As mentioned above, the pricing and packaging of GitHub Copilot X is still being discussed. Currently, we don’t plan to ship these new GitHub Copilot X features as part of GitHub Copilot for Individuals or GitHub Copilot for Business but potentially as part of a new upcoming higher priced SKU. 
● Because most of these features will be included as part of a higher priced SKU for GitHub Copilot, we should refrain from promising these features as a part of GitHub Copilot for 
Individual or GitHub Copilot for Business in the future. 
● For availability and pricing, we should say the following: GitHub Copilot X is currently a representation of GitHub’s vision for the future rather than an available product offering of GitHub Copilot. As we continue to design, test, and build features that fall into the GitHub Copilot X vision, we are also taking the time to determine the best way to provide them to our customers.

## 1. What does the X represent in GitHub Copilot X? 
  

The “X” represents a placeholder for where we intend GitHub Copilot to become available, and what we expect it to be capable of doing (e.g. “Copilot <for pull requests>“, “Copilot <for security>“). It is extending the product from one experience, code completion, to X experiences across the developer’s workflow. GitHub Copilot will always need to be so much more tomorrow than what it currently is today. 
Additionally, The “X”, indicates the magnitude of impact we intend to have on developer achievement. Therefore, it’s a statement of intent, and a commitment to developers, as we collectively enter the age of AI. We want the industry to be confident in GitHub Copilot, and for engineering teams to view it as the neXus of their future growth. 
## 2. When will GitHub Copilot X be available and how much does it cost? 
  

GitHub Copilot X is currently a representation of GitHub’s vision for the future rather than an available product offering of GitHub Copilot. As we continue to design, test, and build features that fall into the GitHub Copilot X vision, we are also taking the time to determine the best way to provide them to our customers. 
3. How do I get access to the upcoming features introduced with GitHub Copilot X? 
  

While we are unable to guarantee access to each feature, you can submit your interest by joining the waitlist to preview the features that you are interested in. Joining one waitlist does not confirm your interest in more than one feature, so you must join each separately. Please note we currently don’t have guaranteed timelines for access. 
Once you get access to preview a feature, please keep in mind that what you are getting access to is considered beta or a technical preview, meaning the feature may still have some kinks to work out. 
Enterprises interested in using GitHub Copilot Chat beta can follow the instructions outlined in our July 20 blog post announcing availability for all Business users.
## 4. Will these upcoming features be included in GitHub Copilot for Business or GitHub Copilot for Individuals? 
  

GitHub Copilot for Business and GitHub Copilot for Individuals will continue to be offered with the same feature set you know today. As we continue to design, test, and build features that fall into the GitHub Copilot X vision, we are also taking the time to determine the best way to provide them to our customers, which may include changes to Copilot for Business and Copilot for Individuals. 
## 5. What is GitHub’s perspective on responsible use of AI? 
  

We’ve been committed to innovating responsibly with GitHub Copilot from the start and will continue to invest in the AI-powered developer experience of the future. And as a Microsoft company, we are committed to making sure AI systems are developed responsibly and in ways that warrant people’s trust. Here are just some of the principles we are committed to with GitHub Copilot: 
Keeping it professional. We apply sentiment analysis to suggestions to keep slang, slurs, and hate speech out of GitHub Copilot responses. 
Improving code quality. We don't just pass-through any suggestion produced by the model. We also subject every suggestion to filters that evaluate code quality. While we can't guarantee that every suggestion is perfect, our filters are getting better all the time and nudging developers toward better quality code. 
Protecting user data. We know that user edit actions, source code snippets, and URLs of repositories and file paths are sensitive data. Consequently, several measures of protection are applied, including data encryption both in transit and at rest as well as strict requirements for GitHub personnel to access data. 
## 6. Are there any prerequisites to get access to the technical preview for GitHub Copilot Chat? 
  

At this time, the technical preview is for VS or VSCode users. An active subscription to GitHub Copilot for Business or GitHub Copilot for Individuals is required for access to GitHub Copilot Chat. 
## 7. Are there any prerequisites to get access to the technical preview for GitHub Copilot for Pull Requests? 
  

You must be an organization admin or an individual repository owner in order to join the waitlist to preview GitHub Copilot for Pull Requests. 
## 8. Are there any prerequisites to get access to the technical preview for GitHub Copilot for Docs? 
  

We have currently closed the technical preview for Copilot for Docs, sign up for the Private Beta will be available after GitHub Universe 2023.
## 9. Are there any prerequisites to get access to the technical preview for GitHub Copilot for CLI? 
  

An active subscription to GitHub Copilot for Business or GitHub Copilot for Individuals is required for access to GitHub Copilot for CLI. 
## 10. How is this better than just buying ChatGPT Plus for $20/month? 
  

GitHub Copilot X integrates AI experiences natively into core features of GitHub (i.e., pull requests) as well as within key steps of the development lifecycle (i.e., documentation, CLI), in addition to code generation within the IDE (i.e., inline code suggestion, chat, voice). ChatGPT Plus allows you to generate code, but it is not fine-tuned for the software development lifecycle and does not integrate within the developer workflow, including using GitHub, like GitHub Copilot X. 
## 11. Will Copilot Chat allow users to manipulate Copilot into suggesting outputs that match public code? 
  

We firmly believe AI will transform the way the world builds software and have developed all of our AI solutions, including GitHub Copilot Chat, in a responsible manner. Part of that entails rolling these solutions out in a measured way, which allows us to observe how users engage with new features like chat before making them generally available. We’ll collect user feedback during the technical preview and use those insights to fine-tune the feature before GA.
12. 
13. Can you comment on the GitHub Copilot litigation? 
  

We firmly believe AI will transform the way the world builds software, leading to increased productivity and most importantly, happier developers. At the same time, it’s not uncommon to see some level of litigation around this type of innovation. We’ve been committed to innovating responsibly with Copilot from the start and will continue to invest in and advocate for the AI-powered developer experience of the future. 
14. This looks like a random grab bag of features. 
  

The rise of powerful LLMs like GPT-4 make it very easy to make demos that work some of the time, in specific situations. Our experience building Copilot and going to market makes us particularly aware of the challenge that exists between prototype and product. Copilot X is our sneak preview into the kitchen: we are really excited for a future where AI is helpful throughout the software development lifecycle. What we’re showing today is just the tip of the iceberg, and we’re excited to share our earliest efforts in the space.
## 15. For every thing that you’re showing, there are fifty startups whose entire mission is to do that thing. Why is GitHub going to be better at it than the more focused efforts? 
  

A) We have experience productizing AI and we know exactly the scale of effort we’ve signed ourselves up for. Going from 50% reliability to 80% reliability is a mountain of not-obvious work. We’re confident that we’ve got the in-house expertise to repeat that journey as we bring AI to the entire development lifecycle. 
B) GitHub has touchpoints into every phase of the software development lifecycle. In the end, it’s not going to be a specific feature that matters, but how we make developers feel throughout the process. The greatest value is in being helpful everywhere.

GitHub Copilot Chat 
## 23. How does GitHub Copilot Chat compare to OpenAI’s ChatGPT? 
  

GitHub Copilot Chat is focused on the domain of code that provides AI assisted coding functionalities like generating test cases, debugging, code analysis, and proposing fixes, whereas ChatGPT is a general purpose chat client that produces content based on natural language commands. Additionally, GitHub Copilot Chat is actively integrated into the code editor, allowing developers to stay focused without having to shift outside of their IDE.
GitHub Copilot for Pull Requests 
## 25. Which GitHub Copilot for pull request features will I get to use in the technical preview? 
  

At first, technical preview users will get to test description generation for GitHub Copilot for Pull Requests in their repositories. We plan to later provide ghost text within descriptions and then eventually test generation based on context from code. 
GitHub Copilot for Docs 
## 27.What documentation is supported by GitHub Copilot for Docs? 
  

Github Copilot for Docs currently supports indexing private internal documentation and making that information available to developers via Copilot Chat for .com. 
        On-launch, we plan to support a few OSS libraries as well as the GitHub documentation. See https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-docs.
GitHub Copilot in the CLI 
## 29.When will customers get access to GitHub Copilot in the CLI? 
  

Copilot for CLI started admitting users in February and is continuing to admit users. See https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli.
## 30.How can I use GitHub Copilot for CLI? 
  

GitHub Copilot for CLI is being refactored to use the new Copilot Intelligence Platform (i.e. new APIs and service architecture). Staff ship of the new client is expected sometime in FY24 Q2. The legacy client is supported in macOS, with limited support in Windows and Linux. 
Public beta announced at Universe 2023.
